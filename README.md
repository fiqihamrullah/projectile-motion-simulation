# Projectile Motion Simulation 

This application simulates the projectile motion according to parameter inputs by implementing the law of physics.
This is my old project,  I am a fan of demonstrating math science into visual presentation.  I only recently started using Git as my portfolio.

Feel Free to use for learning purpose.
